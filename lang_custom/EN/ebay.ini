BLOCK_main_ebay_DESCRIPTION=Adds an a block advertising items for sale by an eBay seller or from an eBay store. It is more suitable to be used as a main block because if it placed in the side menu the block size is too small and it is hard to be navigated inside of it. The block dimensions width/height could also be adjusted(to fit better on the block area).
BLOCK_main_ebay_USE=Useful for viewing/purchasing eBay products from your website.
BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_seller=This determines the eBay seller ID.
BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_type=This determines the eBay block type. Must be either 'seller' or 'store'. Note that at the time of writing only seller works, due to a problem on eBay's end. Default: 'store'.
BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_query=This determines the eBay search criteria to filter displayed products.
BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_height=This determines the eBay block height in pixels(i.e. '350'). Default: '350'.

BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_domain=This is the domain suffix for the country the store/seller is configured in (e.g. 'fr' or 'co.uk' or 'com'). Whilst ebay stores/sellers can be viewed from any domain when actually browsing eBay's own websites, you need to get this right here for the widget to work. Default: 'com'.
BLOCK_main_ebay_PARAM_lang=This is the language used for the widget. It has to either be correct for what the store/seller is configured as (e.g. 'fr-fr' or 'en-us'), or left blank for disregardless display in English. Default: ''.
