TIP_0a=Welcome to the Admin Zone, the administrative heart of your website. The first thing you should do with a new ocPortal installation is to run the &lsquo;Setup Wizard&rsquo; to perform basic configuration. You will find the site wizard under the &lsquo;Setup&rsquo; section. If you are not sure which area of ocPortal to use to perform a task, try using the &lsquo;Search for&rsquo;; feature in the top-right. You may also refer to the ocPortal documentation for help.\n\nDismiss this tip when you are ready to move on to the next level of tips.
TIP_1a=You can create a quick personalised theme using the &lsquo;Theme Wizard&rsquo;, located in the &lsquo;Style&rsquo; section.
TIP_1b=Content is King: almost all good websites have good content, so get working on your own unique content as soon as possible.
TIP_1c=Presentation is key: visitors judge websites in a fraction of a second.
TIP_1d=Quality not quantity: ocPortal has a huge number of public-facing features for you to use, but don't feel the need to use them all, because you can't afford to overwhelm your visitors or dilute your site.
TIP_1e=Keep regular backups: even if you make no mistakes and know precisely what you're doing, there could be a fire in your remote data center, for example.
TIP_1f=If stuck, check the documentation. If you're still stuck, the chat button in the footer opens up your support options on the page you're at. You should actually read the documentation anyway as you will find it an enormous help &ndash; we have provided general advice on running websites as well as ocPortal-specific advice.
TIP_1g=Please <a href="https://ocportal.com/site/tickets/ticket.htm?ticket_template=general_feedback&amp;cost=free">give feedback</a> to ocProducts so that we may improve things in future versions. It is enormously important to us that your ocPortal experience is as good as we can make it.
TIP_1h=The developers of ocPortal, ocProducts, are available to do work on a commercial basis. If you need new features developed for your website and can budget for it <a target="_blank" href="http://ocportal.com/site/commercial_support.htm">consider contacting ocProducts</a>. (If not that's cool too, ocPortal is Open Source so our business model is to serve both the open community and corporate userbases)
TIP_1i=The news system is very flexible and can also be used for blogs and articles. It is actually possible for you to set a privilege (&lsquo;Have personal categories&rsquo;, under the &lsquo;Submission&rsquo; set of privileges) that allows all members of your site to have their own blog.
TIP_1j=To delete something in ocPortal, go to edit it: you will see options for deletion on the edit screen.
TIP_1k=Try to not add excessive text to your website: people have a short atten-
TIP_1l=To edit a theme image, hold down the Ctrl+Shift+Alt keys and click on it (you must be logged in as staff to do this).
TIP_1m=You can quickly make edits to most data in ocPortal just by clicking on it and typing into the edit box that appears. This is one of many examples of cutting-edge &lsquo;<abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">AJAX</abbr>&rsquo; technology used within ocPortal.
TIP_1n=Want to discuss things with other ocPortal users? Visit the <a href="http://ocportal.com/forum/">ocPortal forum</a>.
TIP_1o=You can find just about anything using the Admin Zone search. You can even type in CSS class names and it will give you a link straight through to the code.
TIP_2a=If you like to edit template files by hand using a text editor then you may do so, as long as you disable the Template cache until you finish your editing.
TIP_2b=It's important to understand the structure of your website: ocPortal actually goes to incredible lengths to make sure that all your data is meticulously organised so that permissions can be assigned in an easy and logical way (and of course so that your website isn't a muddle to navigate). You can see the complete structure of your website using the &lsquo;Site Tree Editor&rsquo; from the &lsquo;Structure&rsquo; section.
TIP_2c=If you are a Windows users, you might consider ditching Internet Explorer and use an alternative but equally free browser, <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> or <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>. Not only are these browsers better at rendering pages, but by switching you help break the monopoly Microsoft have constructed with IE &ndash; for years IE has stagnated, and developers such as ocProducts can attest to the inordinate number of development problems that occur due to Microsoft's neglect. It limits progress in a real way.
TIP_2d=Don't attach files more than a few megabytes in size to forms whenever possible &ndash; instead, upload them using FTP and reference their URLs. It is a limitation of the World Wide Web that form-based uploads are unstable.
TIP_2e=The best design tool in the world is a pen and pad of paper, or if you have one, a whiteboard. Design your website layout off the computer, and then implement it bit-by-bit in ocPortal.
TIP_2f=A forum community can make a website come alive &ndash; it can also make a website lose its controlled, professional feel. This is just one example demonstrating why you need to give thought to which ocPortal features you want to use, and how to use them.
TIP_2g=Use the inbuilt statistics features to see how your site is being used. With careful study, you can identify navigation problems, and where your strengths and weaknesses are (to allow you to focus your efforts).
TIP_2h=A common need is to give people access by default, but to be able to take away access on abuse. To do this, you could switch a user's usergroup to one with less privileges, but this requires maintaining of full permission sets for multiple usergroups. If you are using OCF, a better technique is to define a new &lsquo;default usergroup&rsquo; that only has permissions for the abusable feature &ndash; new users will be put into that usergroup as well as the main usergroup which has wider permissions. To remove a user after their abuse, just remove them from the new &lsquo;default usergroup&rsquo;.
TIP_2i=ocPortal can cater for websites large and small &ndash; as your site grows, stop trying to set permissions by editing things, and start using the &lsquo;Permission tree editor&rsquo; &ndash; it'll save you a lot of time when making batch changes as well as allowing you to see a complete view of your permissions!
TIP_2j=People will always abuse you and your website regardless of how good it is. Large websites will always get negative feedback from users who are super-liberal (thinking they have a right to free action on your website without following any rules) and users who are super-conservative (thinking that everyone should act in the certain way that represents their personal viewpoint). As a webmaster, you need a thick skin &ndash; try and be fair and balanced, and don't take criticism too harshly, especially when it conflicts.
TIP_2k=Use transparent redirection pages to allow zones to share panels.
TIP_2l=If you want the forum to be the heart of your website, add a transparent redirection so that the Welcome zone &lsquo;start&rsquo; page points to the Forum zone &lsquo;forumview&rsquo; page.
TIP_2k=Turn on the ocProducts error e-mails if they're not already. We regularly fix minor bugs that people wouldn't bother report based on these, making the product more stable for everyone. You can do this by going to Setup > Configuration > Site
TIP_2l=Use the Comcode <var>hide</var> tag to place messages that are obscured until consciously uncovered. This is great for placing warnings (such as <kbd>spoilers</kbd> or disclaimers) or hiding answers to questions so to give the reader time to think.
TIP_2m=If you are a Firefox user, make use of the Web Developer Toolbar extension. It contains great tools for interactively working with CSS that you can use in supplement to ocPortal's own CSS editing capability (to test out ideas interactively before saving them in ocPortal).
TIP_2n=Consider using permission-restricted forums for discussion between staff even if you have real-world meetings. You will find them a very convenient for having quick thoughtful discussions where no participator feels pressed to &lsquo;answer on the spot&rsquo;. There is also less need to co-schedule or take minutes.
TIP_2o=The point system is a great community invigoration tool &ndash; by creating an economy, you add a new facet to your community that raises interest level and a competitive factor.
TIP_2p=Regularly change add content to your website, or randomise content display using the <kbd>main_content</kbd> block. This will keep your visitors returning, which in turn will make them more likely to recommend your website to others.
TIP_2q=You will find the &lsquo;Show template edit links&rsquo; and &lsquo;Template tree&rsquo; and &lsquo;Language&rsquo; options in the list of options in the footer very useful for changing the templates and language strings of the page you are viewing.
TIP_3n=Don't ever edit ocPortal files if avoidable. Instead, make proper use of the ocPortal <kbd>_custom</kbd> override system: for example if you edit the file sources/global2.php, save your edit as sources_custom/global2.php. This will allow you to perform upgrades more easily. The same applies to theme images: use ocPortal's theme image forms to update images, rather than overriding the source files in the default theme.
TIP_3a=If you have untrustworthy people around you, switch to conceded mode after using the Admin or CMS zones&hellip; that way, anyone using your computer will need need your password to cause any mischief.
TIP_3b=Use the &lsquo;SU&rsquo; feature to test your site as any user of your choosing. It's easy (regrettably, but inevitably) to make mistakes when setting permissions and lock off an important portion of your site to those that should be able to see it. You can activate &lsquo;SU&rsquo; manually by appending <kbd>&amp;keep_su=&lt;username&gt;</kbd> to the URL. &lsquo;SU&rsquo; is superior to logging in as another member not just due to speed, but also because you will still be able to see things such as stack traces.
TIP_3c=When designing ocPortal sites, you need to consider the modularity of the system. Modularity is fantastic because it allows ocPortal to serve so many different kinds of website with just a shuffling around of the features: but it also inevitably requires a different way of thinking. You need to think about how to achieve things using the features ocPortal provides, rather than trying to force ocPortal to conform to rigid preconceptions. The end result is often a better website than what was originally planned, because of the extras ocPortal offers.
TIP_3d=When themeing, you need to think in terms of editing and rearranging individual sections of the site as well as global sweeping things such as &lsquo;standard boxes&rsquo; &ndash; in other words, you need to think in terms of the design framework that ocPortal defines, rather than just in terms of an end design. With experience, you won't feel limited by ocPortal, but assisted &ndash; you'll be able to make use of the framework to carry your style.
TIP_3e=Whilst the &lsquo;Theme Wizard&rsquo; can automatically create a theme for you, it won't create unique designs variations. You can, however, radically change the layout of your website by changing three things: CSS, templates and theme images. All the tools to allow you to do this are in ocPortal &ndash; you will need a basic understanding of the technologies involved, but once learnt, you'll be able to make your website unrecognisable to any other ocPortal website. Alternatively you could download a premade theme as an addon, or pay someone to make one.
TIP_3f=Creating ocPortal and maintaining it at the relatively low/free-cost point that we do is enormously difficult for ocProducts and requires us to sell thousands of licences annually to pay ourselves even average salaries: if you love the product, please help us make it better by helping us gain new customers. If every user refers one more unique user, everyone would be using ocPortal and we'd have more money to reinvest. We help you grow your community &ndash; help us grow ours.
TIP_3g=Please refer ocPortal to others and help grow the community.
TIP_3h=You can quickly add large numbers of downloads by uploading them to a directory using FTP, then using the FTP importer to add them all to the download system in one sweep.
TIP_3i=Press the menu button towards the bottom-left of the screen to bring up the management menu wherever you are on your website. This really speeds up administration.
TIP_3j=Press Alt+O to bring up the OcCLE command line wherever you are on your website. Experts use OcCLE to interactively work with the guts of ocPortal, so that they don't have to program new features into it every time they want to do something unusual.
TIP_3k=You may place other websites' syndicated news on your site by using the RSS blocks. These blocks support both Atom and RSS feeds.
TIP_3l=Use Custom Comcode to quickly build Comcode pages that follow a common pattern.
TIP_3m=The calendar is useful for much more than just group scheduling &ndash; the reminder system is particularly useful and allows it to be used as a secure substitute for a diary (as the Internet becomes available just about anywhere, the advantage to storing information on the Internet becomes more significant).
TIP_3n=Use the Comcode <var>page</var> tag instead of the <var>url</var> tag whenever referring to local URLs. By doing this you can gain protection against changes in URL behaviour between versions and the effect on URLs by pages moved between zones.
TIP_3o=The language editor is not just useful for translating the original ocPortal British English to another language &ndash; it is also useful for stylistic customisation of language.
TIP_3p=If you need to place some Comcode within Comcode, written in literal form (i.e. not parsed), either place it within a Comcode <var>code</var> tag, or put <kbd>\</kbd> symbols before the <kbd>[</kbd> symbols.
TIP_3q=If you are using Firefox, try the Firebug extension. It is a fantastic aid to themeing your website because it will allow you to quickly find how the CSS ties into the XHTML, and also let you interactively test changes. Firebug isn't a permanent editor though, so you'll need to manually copy any of your changes back into ocPortal's CSS and save them (another extension, Firediff, will help with that though). Most browsers now have an equivalent to Firebug built-in.
TIP_4a=If you have the associated notification enabled, ocPortal will send out notifications whenever it parses Comcode with broken links in it: this will help you make sure your website stays stable. If you clear your Comcode cache, then ocPortal will have to reparse all Comcode, and hence will pick up any newly broken links.
TIP_4b=The calendar can be used as a scheduling system for system commands. If you're a real ocPortal Pro, you'll be able to write scripts in OcCLE to execute at regular intervals of your chosing.
TIP_4c=If you have a lot of experience with ocPortal, you may want to consider getting yourself professionally qualified. It's free, easy (it's done online) and you may be able to get listed in our directory of experts, giving you the opportunity to be paid doing freelance ocPortal customisations for others.
TIP_4d=When editing templates, use Tempcode if you need to perform simple or even advanced calculations; for example, the IF_NON_EMPTY Tempcode directive is very useful when wrapping extra HTML around a template parameter that may sometimes be blank (we use IF_NON_EMPTY to only apply the extra HTML in the case where it is surrounding something actually there).
TIP_4e=If you are running a site where security is a high priority and if you are using OCF, consider enabling IP address-based security for your primary usergroup. This way, even if someone manages to steal your password, they can't access your account from a computer other than yours, unless they have access to your e-mail.
TIP_4f=If you are struggling to find what permissions to set, and don't mind dealing with some technical tools and language, you can use the Firefox/Firebug/FirePHP combination with ocPortal. You need to be using the Firefox web browser, to install Firebug, to enable all the Firebug panels for your website, and to install FirePHP. You then need to temporarily append <kbd>&amp;keep_firephp=1</kbd> to your website URL in your browser. If things have gone right, a full list of permissions, templates, and queries, used to generate the screen you're viewing will be shown within Firebug.
TIP_4g=RSS/Atom if a fantastic way to keep on-top of activity on your website. If you'd like to use RSS/Atom feeds but need them to feature privileged content (i.e. more than just guest content), add <kbd>&amp;auth=1</kbd> to the URL in your feed reader. This will cause the reader to prompt you for login details, and will result in an privileged feed.
ALL_TIPS_READ=You have permanently dismissed all the tips in the system. Best wishes with your website, ocProducts.
